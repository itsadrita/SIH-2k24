### Text/Voice to Indian Sign Language (ISL) Converter
This project is designed to help bridge the communication gap between the hearing and the deaf communities by converting text or voice input into Indian Sign Language (ISL). The system uses MediaPipe to extract landmarks for hands, face, and arms, and then maps these landmarks to the appropriate ISL gestures. Users can input text or speech to have it translated into sign language, allowing for seamless communication with individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

### Features
* Converts text and speech to ISL.
* MediaPipe is used to extract landmarks of hands (left and right), face, and arms.
* Real-time sign language rendering through accurate mapping of body landmarks.
* Ability to process voice input using speech-to-text models and convert the recognized text into ISL.
* User-friendly interface for easy text/voice input.
